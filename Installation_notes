Linear Fascicle Evaluation (LiFE) Matlab code as used in the paper:
"Multidimensional encoding of brain connectomes", by Cesar F. Caiafa and Franco Perstilli, 2016 (submitted)

*** PLEASE COMPLETE THE STEPS DESCRIBED BELOW BEFORE USING LIFE ***

1- Copy LiFE files:
   Unpack the compressed file LiFE.zip. This should create a directory named LiFE

2- Set LiFE path and generate MEX files:
   For a fast implementation of the optimization process in LiFE it is required to have installed the proper 
   compiled version (mex files) of some functions. This document gives a guide on how to generate your own
   mex files for your specific Matlab version and operating system:
   
   2.1- Verify you have a valid compiler installed in your system (see this page http://www.mathworks.com/support/compilers). For example, 
   in Mac OS, you   can get a compiler for free by download the Xcode package from Apple Store.

   2.2- In Matlab, go to your current life path, type LiFE_setup \return to start generating your mex files. After doing that you will 
   receive a c confirmation or an error message. If the mex file was correctly generated you will be able to see it inside the folder \mexfiles

2- Download and install vistasoft package from https://github.com/vistalab/vistasoft
   Vistasoft Mtlab package includes a series of useful routines for analysis of MRI data.

3- Download and install MBA - Matlab Brain Anatomy package from https://github.com/francopestilli/mba

4- Test your LiFE installation by running the demo scripts included in the folder /life/spripts/
